A project to understand the working of Vite + React and to showcase some of my travel collections.

Things to learn:

1. how to configure react's import statement to use "src" folder as the base url. Has something to do with the [Module Resolutions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules/theory.html#module-resolution).

Things I learned while making this project:

1. Client-side routing using react-router-dom and &lt;Routes&gt;.
2. React reducers.
3. React state contexts.
4. Using Contexts with Reducers for managing state of multiple components from a central point.
